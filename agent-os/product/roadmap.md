**Implementation Principles:**
- Each feature includes frontend UI (React/Next.js), backend API (Supabase edge functions), database schema (PostgreSQL), and comprehensive testing
- Motion interactions prioritize 60fps performance with GSAP + Framer Motion optimization
- All 3D features include performance monitoring and fallback to 2D on lower-end devices
- Story curation runs as background job with progress tracking and error handling
- Mobile optimizations tested on iOS Safari, Android Chrome, and various screen sizes
