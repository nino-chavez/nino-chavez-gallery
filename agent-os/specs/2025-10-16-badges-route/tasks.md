# Task Breakdown: Profile Badges Route with Discovery Progress

## Overview
Total Tasks: 11 tasks across 3 task groups
Estimated Timeline: 5-6 working days
Assigned Implementers: ui-designer, testing-engineer
Critical Path: Task Groups 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 (sequential dependencies)

## Executive Summary

This implementation creates the `/profile/badges` route that displays the gamification/discovery layer. The work focuses on **pure integration** of the existing [`BadgeCollection`](../../src/components/delight/DiscoveryBadges.tsx:180) component with localStorage persistence. This is the **simplest of the three new routes** with no API calls, no complex state management, and no interactive features beyond basic navigation.

**Key Simplifications:**
- No database changes required (localStorage only)
- No API endpoints needed (purely client-side)
- No new components to build (100% reuse of BadgeCollection)
- No complex interactions (static display + single navigation button)
- Minimal test coverage (10-18 tests maximum vs 30+ for other routes)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Start with route foundation and localStorage integration
- Add progressive enhancement (stats ‚Üí progress ‚Üí navigation)
- Test at each checkpoint before moving to next phase
- All tasks have clear rollback paths

## Execution Order & Critical Path

### Sequential Dependencies (Must follow this order)
1. **Task Group 1** (Days 1-2) - Foundation must complete first
2. **Task Group 2** (Days 3-4) - Requires localStorage integration working
3. **Task Group 3** (Days 5-6) - Requires all badge display features complete

### Critical Path (Blocking Tasks)
These tasks block other work and should be prioritized:
- Task 1.2: Create badges page route (blocks all other tasks)
- Task 1.3: Implement localStorage utilities (blocks data loading)
- Task 2.1: Integrate BadgeCollection (blocks visual display)
- Task 2.3: Implement progress calculator (blocks progress display)
- Task 3.1: Add navigation button (blocks navigation testing)

### Parallel Work Opportunities
These tasks can run simultaneously:
- **After Task Group 1 completes:**
  - Task 2.0 (write display tests) + Task 2.1 (integrate BadgeCollection)
- **After Task 1.3 completes:**
  - Task 2.1 (integrate BadgeCollection) + Task 2.2 (implement stats bar)

---

## Testing Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Route Foundation (End of Day 2)
**Run:** Tests from Task 1.1 (2-4 tests)
**Verify:**
- /profile/badges route returns 200
- Page renders header
- localStorage data loads without errors
- Default empty state works

### Checkpoint 2: Badge Display (End of Day 4)
**Run:** Tests from Task 1.1 + Task 2.0 (4-10 tests total)
**Verify:**
- BadgeCollection renders correctly
- Locked/unlocked states display properly
- Stats bar shows accurate counts
- Progress indicators display

### Checkpoint 3: Navigation & Completion (End of Day 6)
**Run:** All badges feature tests (10-18 tests maximum)
**Verify:**
- Keep Exploring button works
- Keyboard navigation complete
- All critical workflows pass
- Responsive layout correct

---

## Rollback Plan

Each task group has a safe rollback strategy:

### If Task Group 1 Fails
**Impact:** No badges route exists
**Rollback:** Delete `src/app/profile/` directory, delete localStorage utility
**Risk:** Very Low (isolated new files)

### If Task Group 2 Fails
**Impact:** Badges not displaying or stats broken
**Rollback:** Revert changes to `src/app/profile/badges/page.tsx`, keep route with basic structure
**Risk:** Low (no existing components modified, only BadgeCollection integration)

### If Task Group 3 Fails
**Impact:** Navigation or additional tests not working
**Rollback:** Remove navigation button, keep display-only page, remove additional tests
**Risk:** Very Low (navigation is optional enhancement)
**Note:** Keep git commit after each task for granular rollback

---

## Notes for Implementers

### For ui-designer (Task Groups 1-2)
- You're integrating an existing component, not building new UI
- BadgeCollection is 100% complete - just pass it the right props
- Focus on layout, localStorage integration, and responsive design
- Reference existing pages for patterns (browse, portfolio)
- Test on multiple screen sizes as you build
- No loading spinners needed - localStorage is synchronous

### For testing-engineer (Task Group 3)
- Review existing tests from previous groups first
- Only add tests if critical gaps exist
- Maximum 4-6 additional tests - be highly selective
- Focus on localStorage error scenarios and accessibility
- This is the simplest route - don't over-test
- Use Playwright for E2E tests

### General Tips
- Commit after each completed task for granular rollback
- Test in browser as you build, don't wait until the end
- Ask questions if spec is unclear
- Reference existing code for patterns (browse route, portfolio route)
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- This should be the fastest route to implement (5-6 days max)

### Key Differences from Other Routes
- **No API calls** - Everything is localStorage
- **No complex state** - Just load and display
- **No interactions** - Beyond a single navigation button
- **100% component reuse** - BadgeCollection does all the work
- **Shortest timeline** - Simpler than browse (10-15 days) or portfolio (8-10 days)
