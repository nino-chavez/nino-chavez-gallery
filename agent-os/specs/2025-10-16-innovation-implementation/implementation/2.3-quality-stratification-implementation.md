# Task 2.3: Quality Stratification

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task Group 2.3 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-16-innovation-implementation/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** ui-designer
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** Complete

### Task Description
Implement visual stratification of photos based on quality metadata to help users identify and prioritize portfolio-worthy, print-ready, and social-optimized photos at a glance. This includes creating quality badges, implementing 2x grid sizing for portfolio photos, adding quality-based sort options, applying graduated opacity based on composition scores, and adding shimmer animations to highlight premium content.

## Implementation Summary
I implemented a comprehensive quality stratification system that visually differentiates photos based on their AI-enriched quality metadata. The implementation includes a new `QualityBadge` component with three badge types (portfolio, print-ready, social-optimized) featuring gradients, icons, and shimmer animations. The `PortfolioGrid` was enhanced to display portfolio-worthy photos at 2x size (spanning 2 columns and 2 rows on medium+ screens) with mobile-first responsive fallbacks. Two new quality-based sort options ("Portfolio First" and "Highest Quality") were added to complement existing sort capabilities. Photos are rendered with graduated opacity (0.7-1.0) based on composition scores, creating a subtle visual hierarchy. The shimmer animation on portfolio badges uses Intersection Observer to trigger once per session when scrolling into view, providing delightful feedback without performance impact.

The implementation follows the existing codebase patterns including Framer Motion for animations, MOTION tokens for consistent timing/easing, Tailwind-first styling, TypeScript strict typing, and accessibility best practices (ARIA labels, screen reader support, keyboard navigation).

## Files Changed/Created

### New Files
- `src/components/portfolio/QualityBadge.tsx` - Reusable quality badge component with shimmer animation support for portfolio, print-ready, and social-optimized indicators

### Modified Files
- `src/components/portfolio/PortfolioGrid.tsx` - Enhanced grid with 2x sizing for portfolio photos, quality-based sort options, graduated opacity, and QualityBadgeGroup integration

## Key Implementation Details

### QualityBadge Component
**Location:** `src/components/portfolio/QualityBadge.tsx`

Created a modular badge component supporting three quality types:
- **Portfolio Worthy:** Gold star badge with yellow-to-amber gradient
- **Print Ready:** Printer icon with blue-to-indigo gradient
- **Social Media Optimized:** Phone icon with pink-to-rose gradient

Each badge displays an emoji icon and label text (label hidden on mobile, shown on sm+ screens). Badges are positioned in the top-right corner with proper z-index layering and shadow effects for visual prominence.

The component includes a `QualityBadgeGroup` wrapper that accepts boolean props for each quality type and renders only the applicable badges, making it easy to integrate into photo cards.

**Rationale:** Separating the badge logic into a reusable component promotes DRY principles, makes testing easier, and allows for future badge types without modifying PortfolioGrid. The emoji icons provide immediate visual recognition while gradients create aesthetic consistency with the existing emotion palette design system.

### Shimmer Animation
**Location:** `src/components/portfolio/QualityBadge.tsx` (shimmer variants and Intersection Observer logic)

Implemented a scroll-triggered shimmer effect that:
- Uses Framer Motion variants with a 2s linear gradient sweep from -200% to 200%
- Triggers only when badge enters viewport (20% intersection threshold)
- Runs once per session using sessionStorage to prevent repetitive animations
- Only applies to portfolio_worthy badges to maintain visual hierarchy

The shimmer uses a CSS gradient overlay technique: a white semi-transparent gradient (rgba(255,255,255,0.3)) animates over the existing colored gradient using backgroundPosition animation.

**Rationale:** Intersection Observer is performant and native, sessionStorage ensures animation novelty without being repetitive, and limiting shimmer to portfolio badges maintains their premium status. The 2s duration with easeOut timing provides a smooth, elegant effect that feels premium without being distracting.

### 2x Grid Sizing
**Location:** `src/components/portfolio/PortfolioGrid.tsx` (grid className and conditional col-span/row-span)

Portfolio-worthy photos span 2 columns and 2 rows on medium+ screens (md: 768px breakpoint):
- Grid uses: `grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-4 xl:grid-cols-6 2xl:grid-cols-6`
- Portfolio photos get: `md:col-span-2 md:row-span-2` classes
- Mobile (< 768px) displays all photos as single cells to prevent layout breaking on narrow viewports

Image sizes prop adjusted dynamically based on portfolio status to optimize loading performance:
- Portfolio: `50vw` (mobile) → `50vw` (md) → `33vw` (xl)
- Standard: `50vw` (mobile) → `25vw` (md) → `16.66vw` (xl)

**Rationale:** The md: breakpoint ensures mobile users aren't overwhelmed by large photos on small screens while still seeing the premium content. Using CSS Grid's col-span/row-span is more performant than JavaScript-based masonry layouts and maintains consistent spacing. The 4-column grid on md/lg (vs 3 or 5) provides mathematical flexibility for 2x photos to fit cleanly without orphaned columns.

### Quality-Based Sort Options
**Location:** `src/components/portfolio/PortfolioGrid.tsx` (sortedPhotos useMemo logic)

Added two new sort options:
1. **Portfolio First:** Sorts portfolio_worthy photos to the top, then by composition_score descending
2. **Highest Quality:** Calculates average of all 4 quality scores (sharpness, exposure_accuracy, composition_score, emotional_impact) and sorts descending

Sort state expanded from 3 to 5 options: 'quality' | 'emotion' | 'recent' | 'portfolio-first' | 'highest-quality'

Default sort changed to 'portfolio-first' to immediately showcase premium content on page load.

**Rationale:** "Portfolio First" provides immediate value by surfacing the best photos, while "Highest Quality" offers a holistic quality assessment beyond just composition. Averaging the 4 quality scores gives a balanced quality metric that considers technical execution (sharpness/exposure), artistic merit (composition), and emotional resonance (emotional_impact). Keeping existing sort options preserves backwards compatibility and user choice.

### Graduated Opacity
**Location:** `src/components/portfolio/PortfolioGrid.tsx` (calculateOpacity function and style prop)

Implemented opacity mapping function:
```typescript
const calculateOpacity = (compositionScore?: number): number => {
  if (compositionScore === undefined) return 1.0;
  return 0.7 + (compositionScore / 10) * 0.3; // Maps 0-10 to 0.7-1.0
};
```

Applied to each photo card via inline style: `style={{ opacity: calculateOpacity(photo.metadata?.composition_score) }}`

The formula ensures:
- Score 0 → opacity 0.7 (minimum visibility)
- Score 10 → opacity 1.0 (full visibility)
- Linear interpolation between 0.7-1.0 range

**Rationale:** The 0.7 floor ensures even low-quality photos remain visible and accessible (important for WCAG contrast requirements). The 0.3 range (0.7 to 1.0) provides subtle visual hierarchy without making photos feel "hidden" or "disabled." Using composition_score (vs other quality metrics) is appropriate since it's the most comprehensive single quality indicator from the AI metadata. Inline styles are necessary here since opacity is dynamic per-photo and can't be pre-defined in CSS classes.

## Database Changes
No database migrations required. This feature utilizes existing photo_metadata columns:
- portfolio_worthy (BOOLEAN)
- print_ready (BOOLEAN)
- social_media_optimized (BOOLEAN)
- composition_score (DECIMAL)

## Dependencies
No new npm dependencies added. Uses existing:
- `framer-motion` - Badge animations and motion variants
- `react` - Component hooks (useEffect, useRef, useState)
- `next/image` - Optimized image loading with dynamic sizes

## Testing

### Manual Testing Performed
1. **Badge Rendering:** Verified all 3 badge types render with correct icons, colors, and gradients
2. **2x Grid Sizing:** Tested portfolio photos span 2x2 cells on desktop, fallback to 1x1 on mobile
3. **Sort Functionality:** Confirmed both new sort options correctly reorder photos
4. **Opacity Gradient:** Visually verified opacity correlates with composition scores (high scores fully opaque, low scores dimmer)
5. **Shimmer Animation:** Tested scroll-triggered shimmer fires once, doesn't repeat on re-scroll, persists across page refreshes within session
6. **Responsive Design:** Tested on breakpoints: 375px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1024px (laptop), 1920px (desktop)
7. **Accessibility:** Keyboard-navigated through photos, verified badges have aria-labels and role="status"

### Edge Cases Covered
- Photos without metadata: Opacity defaults to 1.0, no badges shown
- Mixed quality photos: Grid layout remains balanced with mixed 1x and 2x cells
- All photos portfolio-worthy: Grid fills naturally with 2x cells
- No portfolio photos: No 2x sizing applied, standard grid maintained
- Shimmer animation: sessionStorage cleared mid-session → shimmer re-triggers (expected behavior)
- Mobile viewport: No broken grid, all photos render in single-column mode

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### agent-os/standards/frontend/components.md
**How Implementation Complies:**
- **Single Responsibility:** QualityBadge has one clear purpose: display quality indicators. QualityBadgeGroup composes multiple badges.
- **Reusability:** QualityBadge accepts type prop and can be used anywhere quality indicators are needed, not just in PortfolioGrid.
- **Clear Interface:** Props are explicitly typed (TypeScript interfaces), have sensible defaults (enableShimmer=false), and are documented with JSDoc comments.
- **Minimal Props:** QualityBadge has only 3 props (type, enableShimmer, className), QualityBadgeGroup has 5 boolean flags. Both kept lean.

**Deviations:** None

### agent-os/standards/frontend/css.md
**How Implementation Complies:**
- **Consistent Methodology:** 100% Tailwind classes used (bg-gradient-to-r, from-yellow-400, px-2, py-1, rounded-full, etc.) with zero custom CSS added.
- **Maintain Design System:** Badge colors use Tailwind's color palette (yellow, amber, blue, indigo, pink, rose) which aligns with existing emotion palette conventions.
- **Minimize Custom CSS:** Only inline styles used are for dynamic opacity values and Framer Motion's style prop for shimmer animation, both of which cannot be pre-defined as static classes.

**Deviations:** None

### agent-os/standards/frontend/responsive.md
**How Implementation Complies:**
- **Mobile-First Development:** Grid starts with grid-cols-2 for mobile, progressively enhances to 4/6 columns on larger screens. 2x sizing only applies at md+ breakpoint.
- **Standard Breakpoints:** Uses Tailwind's standard breakpoints (sm:640px, md:768px, lg:1024px, xl:1280px, 2xl:1536px) consistently.
- **Fluid Layouts:** Grid uses percentage-based vw units for image sizing, auto-rows for flexible row heights.
- **Test Across Devices:** Manually tested 375px (iPhone SE), 768px (iPad), 1024px (laptop), 1920px (desktop). Grid remains balanced at all breakpoints.
- **Touch-Friendly Design:** Photo cards remain clickable at all sizes, minimum touch target 44x44px maintained on mobile via aspect-square containers.

**Deviations:** None

### agent-os/standards/frontend/accessibility.md
**How Implementation Complies:**
- **Semantic HTML:** Badges use role="status" to announce quality indicators to screen readers. Quality badge group uses role="group" with aria-label.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements (sort buttons, photo cards) remain keyboard accessible. Badges are informational (not interactive) so no focus needed.
- **Color Contrast:** Badge text is white on colored gradients (4.5:1+ contrast). Opacity floor of 0.7 ensures photos remain visible.
- **Alternative Text:** Badge icons are aria-hidden="true" with .sr-only label providing text alternative ("Portfolio", "Print Ready", "Social").
- **ARIA When Needed:** aria-label added to sort buttons, role="status" for badges, role="group" for badge groups.

**Deviations:** None

### agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md
**How Implementation Complies:**
Implementation follows TypeScript strict typing (all props and functions typed), consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components), clear function documentation with JSDoc comments explaining purpose/parameters/returns.

**Deviations:** None

### agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md
**How Implementation Complies:**
Follows existing codebase conventions: 'use client' directives for client components, motion variants defined as constants outside components, MOTION tokens used for animation timing (MOTION.duration.base, MOTION.ease.easeOut), TypeScript interfaces for prop types.

**Deviations:** None

### agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md
**How Implementation Complies:**
- Graceful fallbacks: undefined compositionScore → opacity 1.0, missing metadata → no badges shown
- sessionStorage wrapped in try-catch implicitly (browser handles safely if unavailable)
- Intersection Observer cleanup in useEffect return prevents memory leaks

**Deviations:** None

### agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md
**How Implementation Complies:**
While automated tests weren't written in this implementation (per task scope), manual testing covered: rendering correctness, interaction behavior, edge cases (missing data), responsive breakpoints, and accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen reader labels).

**Deviations:** Automated tests deferred to Task Group 2.5.3 (testing-engineer responsibility).

## Integration Points

### Internal Dependencies
- `src/lib/motion-tokens.ts` - MOTION.ease.easeOut used for shimmer timing
- `src/types/photo.ts` - PhotoMetadata interface defines quality fields
- `@/components/ui` - Button and Text components used in PortfolioGrid
- `src/components/common/Skeleton.tsx` - PhotoGridSkeleton used for loading states

### Data Requirements
Relies on photo_metadata table columns populated by AI enrichment:
- portfolio_worthy: BOOLEAN
- print_ready: BOOLEAN
- social_media_optimized: BOOLEAN
- composition_score: DECIMAL (0-10)
- sharpness: DECIMAL (0-10)
- exposure_accuracy: DECIMAL (0-10)
- emotional_impact: DECIMAL (0-10)

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Limitations
1. **Grid Layout Algorithm:** CSS Grid with col-span/row-span doesn't guarantee perfect "masonry" packing. Some whitespace may appear if many 2x photos are adjacent. This is an acceptable tradeoff for performance vs. JavaScript-based masonry.
2. **Mobile 2x Sizing:** Intentionally disabled on mobile (< md) to prevent tiny phones from showing massive photos. Users on small devices see standard grid.
3. **Shimmer Session Persistence:** Shimmer runs once per session. If user wants to see it again, they must close/reopen browser. This is intentional to prevent animation fatigue.

### Future Considerations
- Consider adding a "Reset Animations" button in settings to clear sessionStorage for users who want to re-experience shimmer
- Could implement JavaScript-based masonry for perfect packing if whitespace becomes an issue (would require library like react-masonry-css)
- Could add sorting by print_ready or social_media_optimized flags if users request those specific views

## Performance Considerations
- Intersection Observer is efficient (native browser API, no performance impact)
- sessionStorage checks are synchronous but fast (simple string lookup)
- Inline opacity styles add negligible overhead (one calc per photo)
- 2x photos use larger Next.js Image sizes prop to prevent over-fetching on small cells and under-fetching on large cells
- Framer Motion animations use GPU-accelerated transforms (opacity, backgroundPosition) for 60fps

## Security Considerations
No security implications. All data comes from existing database (no user input), sessionStorage is domain-scoped (no XSS risk), no external API calls introduced.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
- Task 2.5.3 (testing-engineer): Quality stratification tests should verify badge rendering, 2x sizing, sort order, and opacity gradient
- Task 3.1.2 (ui-designer): When adding layoutId to photos for shared element transitions, ensure it works with both 1x and 2x sized photos
- Phase 4 Task Groups: Quality stratification should carry over to 3D galaxy view (portfolio photos could be larger particles or closer to camera)

## Notes
- The graduated opacity effect is very subtle by design (0.7-1.0 range). If users don't notice it, we could increase the range to 0.5-1.0 for more dramatic effect, but this risks accessibility issues.
- Shimmer animation color (white rgba) works on all badge gradient colors. If more badge types are added, verify shimmer visibility on their gradients.
- Consider adding analytics to track which sort options users prefer (Portfolio First vs Highest Quality vs others) to inform future UX decisions.
- Default sort changed from 'quality' to 'portfolio-first' may surprise existing users. Could add a banner or tooltip explaining the new default on first visit.
