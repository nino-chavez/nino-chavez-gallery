3. Continue accessibility-first approach in all new components

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
While Phase 1 is complete and production-ready, these enhancements could be considered for future iterations:

1. **Enhanced Screen Reader Testing**
   - Add automated screen reader testing with @guidepup/playwright
   - Create more detailed screen reader test scenarios

2. **Visual Regression**
   - Add visual snapshots for focus indicators
   - Capture skeleton loader states

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Add Lighthouse CI integration
   - Monitor Time to Interactive (TTI) metrics

4. **Cross-Browser Testing**
   - Expand test runs to Firefox and WebKit
   - Add mobile viewport testing

## Test Execution Instructions

### Run All Phase 1 Tests

# Full test suite
pnpm test tests/accessibility/phase1-accessibility.spec.ts tests/user-journeys/phase1-foundation.spec.ts

# Accessibility tests only
pnpm test tests/accessibility/phase1-accessibility.spec.ts

# Functional tests only
pnpm test tests/user-journeys/phase1-foundation.spec.ts

# With UI mode for debugging
pnpm test tests/accessibility/phase1-accessibility.spec.ts --ui

# Generate HTML report
pnpm test --reporter=html

- Retry configuration: 1 retry locally, 2 retries on CI
- Parallel execution: 6 workers locally, 4 on CI

## Conclusion

**Phase 1 is PRODUCTION READY.**

All 66 tests pass with 100% coverage of acceptance criteria. The implementation demonstrates:
- ✅ Zero critical accessibility violations (WCAG AA)
- ✅ Robust keyboard navigation
- ✅ Proper semantic HTML structure
- ✅ Professional loading states
- ✅ Stable, error-free routes

The testing infrastructure is solid, maintainable, and provides clear patterns for Phase 2-4 testing.
