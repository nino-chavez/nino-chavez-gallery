# Task 2.1: Emotion Navigation System

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task Group 2.1 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-16-innovation-implementation/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** ui-designer
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Implemented a comprehensive Emotion Navigation System that makes emotion-based filtering the PRIMARY NAVIGATION paradigm for the photography gallery. The system includes context management, navigation cards, emotion halos on photos, filter chips, and emotion indicators on detail pages.

## Implementation Summary
The Emotion Navigation System transforms how users discover and browse photos by making emotions the primary entry point. Users can now click on one of six emotion cards on the homepage to instantly filter the portfolio by emotional tone (triumph, focus, intensity, determination, excitement, serenity). The system persists emotion selections across page navigation using session storage and provides visual feedback through emotion-colored halos around photos and prominent emotion indicators on detail pages.

The implementation follows React best practices with a custom Context provider for global state management, Framer Motion for smooth animations using spring physics from the motion tokens, and responsive design patterns ensuring the interface works seamlessly on mobile (375px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1280px+) viewports.

All components use the EMOTION_PALETTE from the design system, ensuring consistent colors, gradients, and glows across the entire user experience.

## Key Implementation Details

### EmotionContext Provider (Task 2.1.1)
**Location:** `src/contexts/EmotionContext.tsx`

Created a React Context provider that manages the active emotion state across the entire application. The provider:
- Tracks the currently selected emotion (one of 6 types: triumph, focus, intensity, determination, excitement, serenity)
- Persists the selection to session storage so emotion filters survive page navigation
- Provides `setActiveEmotion` and `clearEmotion` methods to all consuming components
- Implements hydration-safe loading to prevent SSR/CSR mismatches

The context uses TypeScript for type safety with the `EmotionType` union type exported for use throughout the app. The hydration pattern ensures the provider waits for client-side mount before rendering children, preventing React hydration errors.

**Rationale:** Context API was chosen over prop drilling or URL params because emotions need to be accessible from any component in the tree (navigation cards, filters, detail pages) and should persist across route changes without polluting URLs.

### EmotionNavigationCard Component (Task 2.1.2)
**Location:** `src/components/emotion/EmotionNavigationCard.tsx`

Built an interactive card component for each emotion that serves as the primary navigation entry point:
- Uses Framer Motion's `motion.button` for smooth hover animations with spring physics
- Applies emotion-specific gradients from EMOTION_PALETTE as backgrounds
- Displays emotion icon, name, and photo count
- On hover: scales to 1.05x and brightens the glow effect using the emotion's configured boxShadow
- On click: sets the active emotion in context and navigates to `/portfolio?emotion={emotion}`

The component uses `MOTION.spring.snappy` for responsive, tactile interactions that feel natural. The gradient overlay technique creates visual depth on hover without performance overhead.

**Rationale:** Spring physics create more natural, human-feeling animations compared to linear transitions. The emotional color system makes each card immediately recognizable and reinforces the emotion-first navigation paradigm.

### Emotion Halos on Photo Cards (Task 2.1.4)
**Location:** `src/components/portfolio/PortfolioGrid.tsx`

Added emotion-colored halos (2px glowing borders) around photo cards in the grid:
- Implemented `getEmotionHalo()` function that calculates box-shadow based on emotion and emotional_impact score
- Halo opacity scales from 0.2 to 0.6 based on emotional_impact (0-10 range)
- Converts EMOTION_PALETTE hex colors to RGBA for dynamic opacity control
- Applied via inline styles to avoid style prop conflicts with Framer Motion

The halo effect is subtle but provides immediate visual feedback about each photo's emotional tone without disrupting the grid layout or adding DOM elements.

**Rationale:** Using box-shadow instead of border or outline ensures halos don't affect layout calculations. The intensity-based opacity creates a natural hierarchy where emotionally impactful photos are more visually prominent.

### Emotion Filter Chips (Task 2.1.5)
**Location:** `src/components/filters/EmotionFilterChips.tsx`

Created a modern chip-based filter UI replacing traditional dropdown/checkbox filters:
- 6 emotion chips in a responsive grid (2 cols mobile, 3 cols tablet, 6 cols desktop)
- Multi-select capability allowing users to filter by multiple emotions simultaneously
- Active chips show emotion-colored backgrounds with gradients and glows
- Smooth hover animations with scale and shadow effects using Framer Motion
- "Clear all" button appears when any emotions are selected
- Live count indicator showing number of selected emotions

Each chip includes the emotion icon and capitalized name. The component is fully keyboard accessible with proper ARIA attributes (aria-pressed, aria-label).

**Rationale:** Chip-based UI is more discoverable and visual than traditional filters. Seeing all 6 options simultaneously with their colors makes the emotion system immediately understandable. Multi-select enables complex queries like "show me triumph OR intensity photos".

### Emotion Indicator on Detail Pages (Task 2.1.6)
**Location:** `src/components/photo/EmotionIndicator.tsx`, `src/components/photo/PhotoDetail.tsx`

Added prominent emotion display on photo detail pages:
- Indicator badge shows emotion icon, name, and emotional_impact score
- Uses emotion gradient background with pulsing glow animation
- Positioned prominently in the metadata sidebar
- Smooth entrance animation (fade + slide up) on page load
- Pulsing glow effect creates gentle, attention-drawing animation without being distracting

The component integrates seamlessly into the existing PhotoDetail layout, appearing between the title/caption and quality metrics.

**Rationale:** Making emotion prominent on detail pages reinforces the emotion-first paradigm and helps users understand why a photo appeared in their filtered results. The pulsing animation draws attention without being aggressive.

### Homepage Integration (Task 2.1.3)
**Location:** `src/app/page.tsx`

Integrated emotion cards into the homepage as the primary navigation:
- Added "Browse by Emotion" section with proper heading hierarchy (H2)
- Calculates photo counts per emotion using useMemo for performance
- Responsive grid: 2 cols mobile (375px+), 3 cols desktop (768px+)
- Positioned prominently at top of page before gallery content
- Photo counts are accurate, pulled from the fetched photos data

The emotion counts calculation runs once per data fetch and memoizes the results, ensuring no performance impact on re-renders.

**Rationale:** Placing emotion cards at the top of the homepage makes them the first interaction point, establishing emotions as the primary way to browse. Showing photo counts provides transparency and helps users decide which emotions to explore.

## Database Changes
No database migrations were required. The implementation uses existing `photo_metadata.emotion` and `photo_metadata.emotional_impact` columns from previous enrichment work.

## Dependencies
No new package dependencies were added. The implementation uses existing dependencies:
- `framer-motion` - For animations
- `react` - For Context API and hooks
- `next/navigation` - For routing

## Testing

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Frontend Components Standard
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/components.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
All components follow single responsibility principle (EmotionContext only manages emotion state, EmotionNavigationCard only renders navigation cards, etc.). Components are highly reusable with prop-based configuration (EmotionNavigationCard takes emotion and photoCount props). Clear interfaces with TypeScript types for all props. State kept local where possible (chip selection state) and lifted to context only when needed across routes (active emotion).

**Deviations:** None

### Frontend CSS Standard
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/css.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Used Tailwind utility classes for all styling (className props with responsive breakpoints like `grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3`). Inline styles only used where necessary for dynamic values (emotion gradient backgrounds, halo box-shadows). Followed existing color system (EMOTION_PALETTE) rather than adding new arbitrary colors.

**Deviations:** None

### Frontend Responsive Design Standard
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/responsive.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Mobile-first development approach - started with 2-column emotion card grid, then added md:grid-cols-3 for desktop. Used responsive padding (px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8) throughout. Tested on mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1280px+). Touch-friendly tap targets on all interactive elements (emotion cards, filter chips) with adequate spacing. Maintained readable typography at all breakpoints.

**Deviations:** None

### Global Coding Style Standard
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Used TypeScript for all components with explicit type annotations. Followed React functional component patterns with hooks. Clear, descriptive naming (EmotionNavigationCard, getEmotionHalo, useEmotion). Consistent code formatting with Prettier-style conventions. Comments explain "why" not "what" (rationale for implementation choices).

**Deviations:** None

### Global Conventions Standard
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Followed Next.js 15 App Router conventions (client components marked with 'use client', server components by default). Component file names match component names (EmotionNavigationCard.tsx). Used absolute imports with @ alias (@/contexts/EmotionContext). Exported types alongside components for reuse.

**Deviations:** None

### Frontend Accessibility Standard
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/accessibility.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Added proper ARIA attributes (aria-label on buttons, aria-pressed on chips, aria-live on count indicators). Semantic HTML (button elements for interactive items, not divs). Keyboard accessible (all interactions work with Tab, Enter, Space). Visual focus indicators inherit from global styles. Screen reader friendly labels on all interactive elements.

**Deviations:** None

## Integration Points

### Context API
- **EmotionContext** provides: `activeEmotion`, `setActiveEmotion`, `clearEmotion`
- Consumed by: EmotionNavigationCard, EmotionFilterChips, potentially future components
- Session storage key: `'active-emotion'`

### Navigation
- Emotion cards navigate to: `/portfolio?emotion={emotion}`
- Portfolio page should read emotion from URL params and apply filter
- Integration point for future portfolio filtering implementation

### Data Dependencies
- Photo counts calculated from `photo.metadata.emotion` field
- Emotion halos use `photo.metadata.emotion` and `photo.metadata.emotional_impact`
- All emotion values must be one of 6 valid types: triumph, focus, intensity, determination, excitement, serenity

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified

### Limitations
1. **Portfolio Filtering Not Yet Implemented**
   - Description: Emotion navigation cards set emotion in context and navigate to portfolio, but portfolio page doesn't yet apply the emotion filter
   - Impact: Users see all photos instead of filtered results
   - Reason: Portfolio filtering logic assigned to different task group
   - Future Consideration: Task Group 2.2 will implement MagneticFilterOrb which connects to portfolio filtering

2. **No Multi-Emotion URL Support**
   - Description: EmotionFilterChips allow multi-select but this doesn't sync to URL params
   - Impact: Multi-emotion selections don't persist on page refresh
   - Reason: URL-based filtering is out of scope for this task group
   - Future Consideration: Could be added in Phase 3 with enhanced routing

## Performance Considerations
- `useMemo` used for emotion count calculations to prevent recalculation on every render
- Session storage operations are minimal (only on emotion change)
- Emotion halo calculation is pure function with no side effects
- Framer Motion animations use GPU-accelerated transforms (scale, opacity)
- No additional network requests introduced
- Component tree depth kept shallow (max 3-4 levels)

## Security Considerations
- Session storage values validated before use (isValidEmotion check)
- No user input directly rendered (all emotion values from predefined enum)
- TypeScript types prevent invalid emotion values
- No XSS vectors introduced (all content from trusted sources)

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
- Task 2.2 (MagneticFilterOrb) will integrate with EmotionContext
- Task 2.3 (Quality Stratification) may reference emotion halos pattern
- Task 3.1.4 (Emotion Theme Persistence) will extend EmotionContext
- All future tasks using emotion filtering should consume EmotionContext

## Notes
- The EMOTION_PALETTE is now established as THE PRIMARY NAVIGATION paradigm
- Consider the emotion cards as the "table of contents" for the entire gallery
- Future implementations should maintain emotion-first design philosophy
- Session storage was chosen over localStorage to reset emotion filter on new browser sessions
- The 6 emotion types are hardcoded because they're part of the core design system (not user-configurable)
- Emotion navigation works well with the existing story curation system (stories already have emotional themes)
