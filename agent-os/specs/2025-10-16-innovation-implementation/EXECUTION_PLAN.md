## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: Phase 4 performance issues**
- Mitigation: LOD system, frustum culling, device detection
- Fallback: Always available 2D mode
- Validation: Performance testing in Task Group 4.7

**Risk 2: Browser compatibility (WebGL)**
- Mitigation: WebGL capability detection
- Fallback: Graceful degradation to 2D grid
- Validation: Test on older devices/browsers

**Risk 3: Bundle size increase**
- Mitigation: Code splitting, lazy loading Three.js
- Target: <150KB for Phase 4 chunk
- Validation: Bundle analyzer in CI

**Risk 4: Animation jank/dropped frames**
- Mitigation: 60fps target, reduced motion support
- Testing: Performance tests in each phase
- Validation: Real device testing

### Schedule Risks

**Risk 1: Phase 4 takes longer than 5 weeks**
- Mitigation: Task Group 4.3 (Photo Particle System) is the most complex - prototype early
- Fallback: Ship Phase 2-3 as "1.5" release if Phase 4 delayed
- Validation: Weekly progress check-ins

**Risk 2: Dependency on Phase 1 completion**
- Mitigation: Phase 1 is small (3 days), high priority
- Fallback: None - Phase 1 is non-negotiable
- Validation: Complete Phase 1 in first session

## Progress Tracking

Track implementation progress in `tasks.md` file. Each task group's checkbox status indicates:
- `[ ]` Not started
- `[~]` In progress (optional, for mid-session saves)
- `[x]` Completed and verified

Update after each session to maintain clear status visibility.

```bash
/agent-os:implement-spec
```

When prompted, specify:
**"Implement Phase 1 only (Task Groups 1.1-1.4)"**

This will delegate to the appropriate subagents and begin the journey from Tier 2 (Differentiated) to Tier 4 (Leading-edge).

**Good luck building the Emotion Galaxy! 🌌**
