# Task Breakdown: Portfolio Route with Quality Gradient & 3D Gravity Views

## Overview
Total Tasks: 15 tasks across 4 task groups
Estimated Timeline: 7-10 working days
Assigned Implementers: ui-designer, testing-engineer
Critical Path: Task Groups 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4 (sequential dependencies)

## Executive Summary

This implementation assembles existing, fully-built portfolio components ([`QualityGradientGrid`](../../src/components/portfolio/QualityGradientGrid.tsx:24), [`PortfolioGrid`](../../src/components/portfolio/PortfolioGrid.tsx:11), [`PhotoGravity`](../../src/components/portfolio/PhotoGravity.tsx:53)) into the new `/portfolio` route. The work focuses on **component orchestration and view mode management** rather than component development. All dependencies are already installed, and all reusable components are 100% complete.

**Key Simplifications:**
- No database changes required (existing schema supports all features)
- No new portfolio components to build (reuse existing 100%)
- No API changes needed (existing `/api/gallery` endpoint handles all queries)
- Test focus: Core user workflows only (15-25 tests maximum)

**Timeline Breakdown:**
- **Days 1-2:** Route foundation and basic structure
- **Days 3-5:** View mode integration (gradient, grid, 3D)
- **Days 6-7:** Navigation, polish, and transitions
- **Days 8-10:** Test review, gap analysis, and validation

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Start with route foundation to enable early testing
- Add progressive enhancement (gradient ‚Üí grid ‚Üí 3D views)
- Test at each checkpoint before moving to next phase
- All tasks have clear rollback paths
- 3D view has performance safeguards (100 photo limit)

## Execution Order & Critical Path

### Sequential Dependencies (Must follow this order)
1. **Task Group 1** (Days 1-2) - Foundation must complete first
2. **Task Group 2** (Days 3-5) - Requires route to exist
3. **Task Group 3** (Days 6-7) - Requires view modes working
4. **Task Group 4** (Days 8-10) - Requires all features implemented

### Critical Path (Blocking Tasks)
These tasks block other work and should be prioritized:
- Task 1.2: Create portfolio page route (blocks all other tasks)
- Task 1.3: Set up SWR data fetching (blocks view mode integration)
- Task 2.1: Create view mode toggle system (blocks all view integrations)
- Task 2.2: Wire URL parameter persistence (blocks navigation testing)
- Task 3.1: Implement photo click navigation (blocks end-to-end flow)

### Parallel Work Opportunities
These tasks can run simultaneously:
- **After Task Group 1 completes:**
  - Task 2.0 (write view mode tests) + Task 2.1 (create toggle system)
  - Task 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 (prepare component integrations) can be started in parallel
- **After Task 2.2 completes:**
  - Task 3.1 (photo navigation) + Task 3.2 (transitions) + Task 3.3 (photo count)

---

## Testing Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Route Foundation (End of Day 2)
**Run:** Tests from Task 1.1 (2-8 tests)
**Verify:**
- /portfolio route returns 200
- Page renders header with title
- Loading state works
- Error state works
- Only portfolio photos (quality 8+) loaded
- Photo count displays

### Checkpoint 2: View Mode Integration (End of Day 5)
**Run:** Tests from Task 1.1 + Task 2.0 (4-16 tests total)
**Verify:**
- All 3 view mode toggles render
- View mode switches correctly
- URL params sync with state
- QualityGradientGrid renders with GSAP animations
- PortfolioGrid renders with masonry layout
- PhotoGravity renders with 3D scene
- 3D fallback works with >100 photos

### Checkpoint 3: Navigation & Polish (End of Day 7)
**Run:** Tests from Tasks 1.1 + 2.0 + 3.0 (6-24 tests total)
**Verify:**
- Photo click navigates correctly
- Return URL preserves view mode
- View mode transitions animate smoothly
- Photo count updates correctly
- Responsive layout works at 3 breakpoints
- Keyboard navigation through toggles works

### Checkpoint 4: Final Validation (End of Day 10)
**Run:** All portfolio feature tests (10-34 tests maximum)
**Verify:**
- All critical workflows pass
- End-to-end journey works
- 3D performance fallback works
- Error recovery works
- URL parameter edge cases handled
- Responsive design correct

---

## Rollback Plan

Each task group has a safe rollback strategy:

### If Task Group 1 Fails
**Impact:** No portfolio route exists
**Rollback:** Delete `src/app/portfolio/` directory
**Risk:** Very Low (isolated new files)

### If Task Group 2 Fails
**Impact:** View modes not working
**Rollback:** Revert changes to `src/app/portfolio/page.tsx`, keep route with static content
**Risk:** Low (no existing components modified)
**Note:** Components are 100% complete, only integration code would need rollback

### If Task Group 3 Fails
**Impact:** Navigation or polish features not working
**Rollback:** Revert navigation and transition code, keep view modes functional
**Risk:** Low (isolated additions to page.tsx)
**Note:** Can ship without transitions if needed

### If Task Group 4 Fails
**Impact:** Additional tests not passing
**Rollback:** Remove additional tests, keep feature with 6-24 tests from earlier groups
**Risk:** Very Low (tests only, no production code affected)

## Notes for Implementers

### For ui-designer (Task Groups 1-3)
- You're orchestrating existing components, not building new ones
- All portfolio components are 100% complete - just integrate them
- Focus on layout, view mode management, and responsive design
- Reference existing pages for patterns (e.g., browse route)
- Test each view mode thoroughly in browser as you build
- Verify 60fps animations visually (GSAP and 3D)
- Test on multiple screen sizes as you build
- Pay attention to URL parameter sync - critical for navigation

### For testing-engineer (Task Group 4)
- Review existing tests from previous groups first
- Only add tests if critical gaps exist
- Maximum 10 additional tests - be highly selective
- Focus on end-to-end workflows, not unit test coverage
- Prioritize:
  1. Full user journey (portfolio ‚Üí view modes ‚Üí photo detail ‚Üí back)
  2. Keyboard navigation for accessibility
  3. 3D view fallback with >100 photos
  4. Critical error scenarios
- Use Playwright for E2E, Jest for integration (if needed)
- Test count should remain under 35 tests total

### General Tips
- Commit after each completed task for granular rollback
- Test in browser as you build, don't wait until the end
- Start with quality gradient (simplest view) to get flow working
- Add grid view next (medium complexity)
- Add 3D view last (most complex, has fallback)
- Ask questions if spec is unclear
- Reference existing code patterns (especially browse route)
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Performance test 3D view with 100 photos before moving on

---

## Browser Support

- Chrome 90+ (primary target)
- Firefox 88+ (full support)
- Safari 14+ (iOS Safari 14+)
- Edge 90+ (full support)
- **Note:** 3D view requires WebGL 2.0 support
  - Gracefully disable 3D toggle if WebGL not available
  - Show message: "3D view requires WebGL 2.0"

---

## Error Handling Scenarios

1. **API fetch fails:** Display error state with retry button
2. **No portfolio photos found:** Show empty state with message and link to browse
3. **3D view initialization fails:** Fallback to Grid view with error message
4. **More than 100 photos in 3D mode:** Show fallback message with Grid view option
5. **Network offline:** Show offline indicator, enable retry when online
6. **Invalid view mode in URL:** Reset to default 'gradient' view
7. **Photo navigation fails:** Stay on portfolio page with error toast
8. **WebGL not supported:** Disable 3D view option, show only Gradient and Grid toggles

---

## Performance Optimization Notes

### Quality Gradient View
- GSAP animations are already optimized (will-change, transform-based)
- Hardware acceleration enabled automatically
- Stagger prevents simultaneous animations

### Grid View
- Framer Motion LayoutGroup handles smooth transitions
- Virtual scrolling not needed (portfolio count reasonable)
- CSS Grid provides efficient layout

### 3D Gravity View
- Strict 100 photo limit enforces performance
- Use `useMemo` to sort and slice photo array
- Three.js scene already optimized by component
- OrbitControls damping set to 0.05 for smooth interaction
- Lerp interpolation (0.1) provides smooth movement without jank

### General Optimizations
- SWR caching reduces API calls (60s dedupe)
- Loading states prevent layout shift
- Lazy load components if initial bundle size grows
- Monitor memory usage during view switches
- Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab to verify 60fps
