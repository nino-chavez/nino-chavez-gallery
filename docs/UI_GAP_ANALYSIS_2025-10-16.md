## Critical Issue: Black Screen / No Visual Content

### Problem
The screenshots captured show a mostly black screen with only a small logo/icon visible. The expected rich, modern UI is not rendering.

### Root Causes Identified

#### 1. No Photo Data Loading
- **Expected:** Portfolio-worthy photos displayed in grids/timelines
- **Actual:** Black screen suggests photos aren't loading or rendering
- **Impact:** PRIMARY BLOCKER - without photos, the entire UI is invisible

#### 2. Potential API/Data Issues
-  The `/api/gallery?portfolioWorthy=true` endpoint may be:
  - Returning empty data
  - Failing silently
  - Not configured for Supabase connection

#### 3. Missing Background Styles
- The black screen suggests the page background isn't styled
- Expected: Modern gradient backgrounds, ambient lighting
- Actual: Default black or missing styles
