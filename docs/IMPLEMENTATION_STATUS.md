## 🔧 TECHNICAL NOTES

### Working Features
- Story viewer with full keyboard controls
- Story generation API with 6 narrative types
- Magnetic filter orbs with physics-based attraction
- Lazy image loading with skeleton loaders
- Sound effects system (needs audio files)

### Known Issues
- @tanstack/react-virtual not installed
- Story APIs need real photo data from Supabase
- Sound effect audio files not included
- Dashboard integrations incomplete

### Performance Considerations
- LazyImage component reduces initial load
- Virtual scrolling will handle 10K+ photos
- Story generation should be async with loading states
- Consider implementing service workers for offline support
